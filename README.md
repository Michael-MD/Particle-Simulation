# Particle in electric and magnetic fields Simulation
Simulation of particle motion due to electric and magnetic fields

Simulates particle motion using numerical runge-kutta method, more specifically Euler's method by solving the lorentz force equaiton in all directions and plotting the results.
The electric and magnetic fields are set as constants in each direction but this can be changed by changing the functons for each named E and B respectively. The step size needs to also be manually set, I found that for cyclic motion the step size needs to be much smaller than say cyloid motion, sometimes even two orders of magnitude.
I have a preloaded example but the parameters can be changed from there to whatever you want. It should also be noted that everything is in cartesian coordinates and will need to be converted to such appropriately where necessary.
This was written by myself and is open source for anyone to use, I would appreciate it if you let me know first via email at mdei0001@student.monash.edu.
